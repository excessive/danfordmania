# DanfordMania

DanfordMania is a port of the StepMania 4 Alpha theme originally created by Chris Danford and inspired by the now defunct In The Groove franchise. The theme was pulled from the last [SM4 commit][sm4] before SM-SSC took over StepMania. The goal of this theme is to be arcade-friendly, running on dedicabs.

This theme is very much a work in progress. Use at your own risk.
